description: This thrilling 1897 memoir reads like a novel as Bullen recounts his
  two years aboard the Cachalot , hunting sperm whales. Packed full of adventure,
  it also provides vivid glimpse into the bygone age of great sailing ships and the
  whaling industry and the era's fascination with the whale.
